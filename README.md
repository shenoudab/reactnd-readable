Readable
========

Readable is my second graded project developed in the Udacity's React Nanodegree.

Installation
------------

You need to install all the dependencies of the project before trying to run it:

    npm install

It requires [this API server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git)
to work.

Launching
---------

After installing the dependencies you can start the node server:

    npm start

and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
